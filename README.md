# Sox-OS
This is Sox OS a operating system
coded in HTML,css and javascript.
Sox is currently in beta so
there isn't really a download
which doesn't matter because the GUI
Is worse than chrome OS.
if you do want to download sox os
I recommend downloading it on a USB
The idea of sox os is you can customize it however you want
so it is open source.
